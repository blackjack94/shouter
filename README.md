SHOUTER (from THOUGHTBOT)
-------------------------

This app is built along with the [Rails Intermediate Workshop](https://upcase.com/intermediate-ruby-on-rails) from [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/).

The purpose is to warm-up my Rails skills after 3-month NO Rails (JAVA for school, to be specific). My last commit to Rails was for [this hackathon app](https://github.com/blackjack94/hackathon/).

And the reason for getting my Rails skills up-and-running is this [MathPedia](https://github.com/blackjack94/mathpedia), a project that makes me so excited about: A place for Maths Olympians to enrich their idea-box via daily readings and practicing contests.

Hope to see you on November 11th, 2014.
